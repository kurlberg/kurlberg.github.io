#+TITLE: KTH math latex letter template
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil author:nil num:nil creator:nil

These are the latest [[file:kthletter.tar][templates]] I have been able to locate.  (Caveat:
there appears to be some conflicts with the older files, in particular
if you have set \homepage in kthletter.cfg .)

(These and some other KTH-relevant latex files can be found
[[https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/giampi/kthlatex][here]]. Unfortunately login is required.)

The files below are out of date, but are kept in case you want to tex
old letters.

For making an official looking letter (i.e., with the KTH logo etc),
the following files might be useful:

 - Latex template for the actual letter: [[file:kthbrev.tex]] (produces
   [[file:kthbrev.pdf]] with pdflatex.)

 - Style file and example configuration file:
   [[file:kthletter-utf8.cls]] [[file:kthletter.cfg]]

 - Graphics for the logos: [[file:KTH_en_cmyk.eps]] [[file:KTH_en_cmyk.pdf]]
   [[file:KTH_sv_cmyk.eps]] [[file:KTH_sv_cmyk.pdf]]

Here is a more up to date [[file:kthbrev2.tar][version]].
