Counting solutions to Diophantine equations

Let f_1,..., f_m be polynomials in n variables with integer
coefficients and N(B) be the number of n-tuples of integers in [-B, B] 
such that  f_1 = ... = f_m = 0.  Several results in analytic number theory
depend on finding good upper bounds for N(B). Vinogradov's mean value
theorem gives a good bound for certain systems of diagonal equations. This
can be be used to give a large zero-free region of Riemann's zeta-function
and to give good bounds for G(k) in Waring's problem. Another example
concerns the class group h(d) of the quadratic field Q(root(-d)). The
n-torsion of h(d) is related to the density of solutions to the
Diophantine equation X^2 +dY^2=Z^n.

Most of the estimates for N(B) so far have been obtained by means of
sieve theory or the theory of exponential sums. The methods of
Faltings are ineffective and esentially limited to cases where there
are only finitely many solutions to the Diophantine equations. But
recently a "determinant method" has been developed which gives very
general results. It was initiated by Bombieri and Pila in the case of
affine curves and then extended to a general method for hypersurfaces
by Heath-Brown in an important paper in Annals of Math. 2002. Recently
a new even more powerful version of the determinant method was
developed by the speaker. It can be applied to very general classes of
algebraic varieties and it gives better estimates for N(B) than could
be obtained with the previous versions of the determinant method. An
important feature is that a number of techniques from algebraic
geometry appear like the theories of Hilbert schemes, Kodaira
dimension and Seshadri constants. We shall in our talk present some
new results obtained with this method like the solutions of two
conjectures of Heath-Brown.
