Mathematics of dimer models
</em>
</center></h1>

Dimer models first appeared in statistical mechanics
and together with the Ising model were first exactly solved
models of phase transitions. Mathematically, dimer
configuration is a perfect matching on vertices of a graph where
matched vertices are connected by edges. Dimer model is
a weighted counting of dimer configurations where the weight
of a configuration is the product of weights of matching edges.
The exact solution was found by Kasteleyn in 1960's. The partition
function of a dimer
model on a graph embedded into a surface of genus $g$ is a linear
combination of $4^g$ Pfaffians. The goal of this colloquium
talk is to outline combinatorial structures related to dimer
models, explain how $4^g$ terms in the Pfaffian formula
for the partition function are related to spin structures
on the surface, and to give a short account of recent results
on the structure of a random dimer configuration for large graphs.
