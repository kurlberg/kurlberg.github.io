Colloquium</center></h2><h3><center>March 22,

University of 
Osnabrueck</center></h1><h1><center><em>Operads, 
Interchange, and Iterated Loop Space 
Structures</em></center></h1>ABSTRACT</body>Operads 
encode certain algerbraic structures. Originally 
they were introduced to study iterated loop 
spaces. The algebraic structure of an n-fold 
space \Omega^nX is encoded by a so-called 
E_n-operad. Each n-fold loop space has an 
E_n-structure and each connected space with an 
E_n-structure is of the weak homotopy type of an 
n-fold loop space.

Now \Omega^nX has n interchanging single loop 
space structures. So a space having an 
E_n-structure should have n interchanging 
E_1-structures and a space having an E_k- and an 
E_l-structure which interchange morally should be 
an E_{k+l}-space.

The talk deals with this questioin. We recall the 
notions of an operad, of an E_n-structure and of 
the interchange of two algebraic structures.

We then address the above mentioned problem. If 
time allows we appply the obtained results to 
show that the topological Hochschild homology 
THH(R) of an E_{n+1}-ring spectrum is an E_n-ring 
spectrum and hence has an interesting 
multiplicative structure if n>=1.

Remarks. 1) The result about THH(R) was also 
obtained by Maria Basterra and Mike Mandell using 
different methods.

2) The talk is about joint work with Zig 
Fiedorowicz and Roland Schwänzl.   </html>
