A homogeneous polynomial $P \in {\mathbb R}[x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_m]$
of degree $n$ is called hyperbolic in direction
$c \in {\mathbb P}^m_{\mathbb R}$ if every real line through $c$
interects the real hypersurface $P(x)=0$ in real points only.
If $P$ is irreducible and the hypersurface $P(x)=0$ is smooth, this
is equivalent to $P(x)=0$ being rigidly isotopic to a nest of
$[n/2]$ spheres around $c$ (and an additional hyperplane if $n$ is odd).

In 1958, Lax conjectured that for $m=2$, a polynomial is hyperbolic in
direction $c$ if and only if $P(x_0,x_1,x_2) =
\det(x_0A_0+x_1A_1+x_2A_2)$ where $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$ are $n \times n$
real symmetric matrices with $c_0A_0+c_1A_1+c_2A_2>0$. This was
recently established by Lewis, Parillo, and Ramana based on a result
of Helton and Vinnikov (a preliminary result along these lines has
been obtained earlier by Dubrovin). A closely related question that
came to be of central importance in control theory is when can one
represent a convex set in ${\mathbb R}^2$ with an algebraic boundary
as the positivity set of a linear matrix pencil. The proofs are based
on a careful analysis of the real structure on the Jacobian variety.

I shall discuss these results and speculate about some related issues
and especially about higher dimensional generalizations.
