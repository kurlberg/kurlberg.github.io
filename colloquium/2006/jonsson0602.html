<em>
Isoperometric inequalities and the number of solutions to algebraic
equations
</em>
</center></h1>

The classical isoperometric inequality in the plane asserts that
the area $S$ of a compact convex set and the length $L$ of its boundary
satisfy $L^2 \ge 4\pi S$, with equality exactly in the case of a circle.
This result, as well as a sharpening by Bonnesen, can be viewed as a
special case of inequalities relating the <em>mixed volumes</em>
of convex sets in Euclidean space, the most celebrated of which are
the <em>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities</em>.
<p>
Algebraic Geometry is (or used to be) about solving polynomial equations.
An important example is the Riemann-Roch problem: given a compact
Riemann surface $\Sigma$, find the dimension of the vector space of
rational
functions on $\Sigma$ with predescribed poles. Generalizing this
problem suitably to higher dimensions leads to the notion of
<em>volume</em> of a divisor on a variety, the focus of much recent
research activity.
<p>
It is well known that there is a dictionary between convex bodies and
(toric) algebraic geometry.  In particular, Teissier and Khovanskii
showed that the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities can be derived from
the <em>Hodge Inequalities</em>.

The talk will be a non-technical survey of this circle of ideas, covering
mostly classical material.
