Separated representations and algorithms for multidimensional
operators


</em>
</center></h1>


Separated representation of multidimensional integral operators with
   radially symmetric kernels leads to fast algorithms for their
   application. This approach is also applicable to singular and
   hypersingular operators ubiquitous in physics. Such approximations
   and algorithms are already used in quantum chemistry and have 
   a strong potential to address computational problems in other
   applications. The talk is an overview of the approach and some of
   its applications.
