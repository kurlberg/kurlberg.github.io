Connection  and connective Segmentation

</center></h1>



<p>
The notion of a connection is a non topological generalisation of
connectivity. Its axiomatics lies on that the union of connected
components that intersect is still connected. Such an approach yields
powerful filters (levelings), and provides the more classical ones
with additional properties (openings). Above all, connection opens a
new way to formulate optimisation, by acting directly on partition
lattices rather than on functionals.
</p>
<p>
Segmenting the space E on which a function f spreads out is defined as
the largest partition of this space into homogeneous regions,
according some criterion. It is proved that this problem admits a
unique largest solution when the underlying criterion is connective,
i.e. when it generates connections over all the subsets where it is
satisfied, and uniquely in that case. The family of all possible
segmentations of f forms a complete lattice S. This feature allows us
to combine the optimal segmentations by means of infima, suprema, and
iterations (partial segmentations). The generality of the theorem
makes it valid for all functions from any space into any other
one. Two propositions make precise the AND and OR combinations of
connective criteria.
</p>
<p>
The soundness of the partition approach is illustrated by listing a
comprehensive series of segmentation techniques. They are classified
in three categories 
</p>
<ul>

<li> 
No seed based segmentations: various modes of regularity are
discussed, which all derived from Lipschitz functions;
</li> 

<li> 
Seed based segmentations : watershed and region growing based
algorithms illustrate this type of situation;
</li>     

<li> 
Feature spaces based segmentations: the segmentation occurs in an
indirect space, such as an histogram, and is then projected back on
the actual space under study.
</li>     

</ul>    
<p>
Hierarchies of connected filters are approached within this
framework. They turn out to be chains of nested partitions in lattice
S. Then specific optimisations can be performed for each level of the
hierarchy, and result in an optimal segmentation. A distinction is
made between weak hierarchies where the partitions increase when going
up in the pyramid, and the strong hierarchies where the various levels
are structured as semi-groups, and particularly as granulometric
semi-groups.
