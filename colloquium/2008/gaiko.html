<em>
Limit Cycle Problems and Their Applications
</em>
</center></h1>



<p>
We establish the global qualitative analysis of planar polynomial
dynamical systems and suggest a new geometric approach to solving
Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem on the maximum number and relative
position of their limit cycles in two special cases of such
systems. First, using geometric properties of four field rotation
parameters of a new canonical system, we present a proof of our
earlier conjecture that the maximum number of limit cycles in a
quadratic system is equal to four and the only possible their
distribution is (3:1). Then, by means of the same geometric approach,
we solve the Problem for Lienard's polynomial system (in this special
case, it is considered as Smale's Thirteenth Problem). Besides,
generalizing the obtained results, we present a solution of Hilbert's
Sixteenth Problem on the maximum number of limit cycles surrounding a
singular point for an arbitrary polynomial system and, applying the
Wintner-Perko termination principle for multiple limit cycles, we
develop an alternative approach to solving the Problem. By means of
this approach, for example, we give another proof of the main theorem
for a quadratic system and complete the global qualitative analysis of
a generalized Lienard's cubic system with three finite
singularities which is very important for applications.

<p>
Finally, we establish the global qualitative analysis of a cubic
centrally symmetric dynamical system which can be used as a learning
model of planar neural networks and a Lienard-type piecewise
linear dynamical system which is well-known in radio-electronics.
