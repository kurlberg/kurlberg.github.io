Presentations for matrix algebras
</em>
</center></h1>

In this lecture I will describe algorithms for obtaining
presentations of matrix algebras. The results are joint work
with Graham Matthews. The idea is to be able to construct
examples in representation theory and homological algebra
using computers. The programs not only compute generators
and relations for a matrix algebra, they also construct
a condensed version that is Morita equivalent to the origin
alalgebra. Other calculations such as the dimension of the
algebra, the Cartan matrix and the endomorphism ring are
made easy in the process. A demonstration of the programs
might be given. The programs run on the MAGMA system.
