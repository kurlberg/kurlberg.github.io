Positive curvature in geometry and relativity
</em>
</center></h1>


This talk will survey the role that is played by positive
curvature (scalar, Ricci, and sectional) in Riemannian geometry and
general relativity. We will describe the many open problems and
conjectures in this area, some of the techniques which have been used
to attack them, and some progress which has been made in recent
years
