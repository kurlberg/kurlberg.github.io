Entropy and localization of eigenfunctions
</em>
</center></h1>



On a compact negatively curved manifold, we study the asymptotic behaviour 
of the eigenfunctions $(\phi_n)$ of the laplacian, when the eigenvalue 
$\lambda_n$ goes to infinity. The Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture
says that the probability measures $|\phi_n(x)|^2dx$ should converge 
weakly to the riemannian volume (the uniform measure). We prove a result
going in this direction, saying that the `dynamical' entropy of these 
measures is asymptotically positive.

<p>
The colloquium talk will be an introduction to the subject.  In a
follow-up talk in the DNA-seminar more details about the proof and
recent developments will given.
