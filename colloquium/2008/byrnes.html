Vector Fields, Angular One-Forms and Periodic Orbits

</center></h1>


Periodic phenomena are pervasive in nature and in engineered
systems. They are exhibited, for example, in idealized models of the
solar system and in observed circadian rythyms by which basic
biological functions are regulated. Electronic devices producing
stable periodic signals underlie the electrification of the world and
wireless communications. For example, every cell-phone has two
antennae which transmit at separate, stable radio frequencies, one
used for transmitting 0's and the other for 1's.  As another example,
geo-positioning satellite systems have satellites rotating about the
earth in stable orbits, each orbit being provided (in advance) in an
almanac in every receiver. 
<p>
We are interested in the basic question as to whether a nowhere zero
vector field on a smooth compact manifold, with or without boundary,
has a periodic orbit. For example, forty years ago Smale asked whether
every nonvanishing smooth vector field on the solid torus had a
periodic orbit. In 1995, K. Kuperberg answered this and the more
famous Seifert Conjecture in the negative. Nonetheless, in this talk
we present a series of positive results on the existence of periodic
orbits that are valid, under some fairly natural hypotheses, in much
greater generality than the setting of Smale's original question. In
particular, we present general results on the existence of periodic
orbits for vector fields on n-manifolds having an ``angular''
one-form. Roughly speaking, an angular one-form is a closed
nonsingular one-form which is a generalized form of angular velocity
analogous to the common interpretation of a Lyapunov function as a
generalized form of energy. 
<p>
In the spirit of Thurston's Geometrization Program, we illustrate
these results in the case of 3-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, using
the validity of the Poincare Hypothesis in all dimensions we prove a
general converse asserting that any asymptotically stable periodic
orbit is contained in a positively invariant  solid n-torus on which
there exists an angular one-form.
