Verifying proofs by reading only 3 bits

</center></h1>


<p>
Probabilistically Checkable Proofs or
more succinctly PCPs have played a
significant role in complexity theory
in the last decade.  A PCP is
a written proof that is verified by
a probabilistic verifier that reads
a very small portion of the proof.
<p>
Not only are PCPs interesting in their own
right but they also lead to strong inapproximability
results for interesting optimization problems.
<p>
As a concrete example take satisfiability of
Boolean formulas.  A classical NP-proof that a
formula is satisfiable is given by an assignment that
satisfies the formula and this is verified
by reading the entire proof and checking that
indeed the assignment satisfies the formula.
<p>
The PCP-theorem says that for satisfiability
and hence for any NP-statement,
there is a PCP that allows proofs of
polynomial size and such that the verifier reads
a constant number of bits, always accepts a
correct proof and rejects and proof of a false
NP-statement with probability at least 1/2.
<p>
In the application to inapproximability it is
important to optimize some of the parameters of
the PCP and in particular we will be interested
in proofs where the verifier only reads three bits.
<p>
In the lecture we will explain, but not prove the PCP-theorem
and discuss the connection to inapproximability.
<p>
If all present understand Swedish the lecture will
be given in Swedish and otherwise in English.
