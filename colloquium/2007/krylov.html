On numerical approximations for linear and fully nonlinear
elliptic and parabolic equations
</em>
</center></h1>

<p>
Fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations appear in numerous
applications of partial differential equations, ranging from control
theory of random processes to differential geometry.
</p><p>
An important class of techniques to solve these equations numerically
are given by various finite-difference schemes.  We will give a brief
introduction to these methods, outline some of their strengths and
limitations, and then show that very strong error bounds hold for
certain types of schemes.  These bounds are new even for linear
elliptic equations, but in fact also apply to parabolic Bellman
equations with Lipschitz coefficients.
</p><p>
Part of the results is obtained in collaboration
with Hongjie Dong from Brown University.
