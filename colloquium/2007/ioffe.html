Tame optimization

</center></h1>

<p>
Variational analysis was born and developed in the last quater of the
20th century as a response to the need of optimization and control
theories in techniques capable of dealing with non-smoothness and
discontinuities of sets, functions and mappings. It was recognized
from the outset that efficiency of the new theory in concrete
situations heavily depends on how well the behavior and structure of
the object is determined by its local approximations provided by the
new theory.  A search for classes of "good" objects, sufficiently
broad to contain practically important types of non-smoothness and
discontinuities and, at the same time, void of various pathologies
typical for such objects was one of the dominating themes in
variational analysis and non-smooth optimization since the very
beginning.
</p>
<p>
Tame sets, functions and mappings that were intensively studied in
algebraic geometry approximately at the same time seem to provide
an ideal response to this need. In the talk I shall briefly discuss some
basic facts of the theory of o-minimal structures and a number of
applications demonstrating the power and potential of definable (tame)
objects as regards optimization theory.
