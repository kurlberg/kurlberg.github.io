<em>
 The Geometry of Grains
</em>
</center></h1>

	
A metal or ceramic is naturally decomposed into cells called
"grains". The geometry and combinatorics of this cell complex
influence the properties of the material. Some interesting
mathematical problems arise in trying to understand the time evolution
of these grains.  In 1952, von Neumann gave a simple formula for the
growth rate of a grain in 2 dimensions, which has been used as the
basis for much of the work on grain evolution.  This formula will be
generalized to 3 (and higher) dimensions (joint work with David
Srolovitz).
