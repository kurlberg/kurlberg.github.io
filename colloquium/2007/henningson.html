quantum field theory: some surprises  of the

</em></center></h1>ABSTRACT: </body>
 Quantum 
field theory has been immensely successful when 
applied to physics:
Predictions from quantum electrodynamics agree with experiments to
a precision of up to ten significant digits. The standard model of elementary
particle physics has correctly predicted and described a wide variety
of phenomena. Further exciting developments are expected when the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN starts operating next year.

Mathematically the situation is more troublesome:
Despite many efforts, no non-trivial example of a quantum field theory  in four
space-time dimensions has yet been rigorously constructed. To make progress
on this issue, it appears fruitful to consider 
relatives of the theories that appear
in nature, but with larger amounts of (super)symmetry. Yang-Mills theories with
maximally extended supersymmetry are then a natural place to start.

In this talk, we will review some aspects of these beautiful and fascinating
theories. In particular, we will describe the by 
now well established, but still
rather mysterious, S-duality property, which indicates that maybe these quantum
theories are neither four-dimensional nor field 
theories after all...</html>
