<em>
Do we understand 19th century enumerative geometry?
</em>
</center></h1>

We take a look at the status of Hilbert's 15th problem
in 2005, which was to justify the counting of geometric
figures done by Schubert and others between 1850 and 1900.
In particular, we address the question: How well do we
understand the methods used by these mathematicians?
