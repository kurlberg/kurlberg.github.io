GRAPHS</em></center></h1>ABSTRACT: </body>The 
simplest type of random graphs is obtained by 
taking a (large) set of vertices and then adding 
edges at random such that each pair of vertices 
is joined with some probability p, independently 
of all other edges. A different but related 
random graph is obtained by fixing the number of 
edges and then placing them at random, uniformly 
over all possible positions. The study of such 
random graphs was initiated by Erdös and Renyi in 
1960. I will describe some classical and some 
rather new results on the structure of such 
random graphs. A main result is the existence of 
a giant component, with a large part of all 
vertices, when the number of edges is 
sufficiently large. I will also say something 
about other, less homogeneous, types of random 
graphs that have been studied recently, partly 
motivated by a desire to model the structure of 
the Internet by random graphs.</html>
