<em>
The KdV and Camassa-Holm equations
</em>
</center></h1>






The well-known KdV equation was proposed in 1895
   to describe long waves in shallow water.  It is now known 
   to have explicit solutions (multi-solitons) with interesting 
   interactions, computable in an unexpected way.  
   The same is true of an equation proposed much more recently: 
   the Camassa-Holm equation.  The C-H special solutions 
   (peakons, antipeakons) have even more interesting interactions.  
   They come from finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems and can 
   be calculated explicitly, but in a completely different way 
   from KdV.
