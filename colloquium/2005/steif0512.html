<em>
Coin Flipping Protocols
</em>
</center></h1>

The following two models which are partially motivated from
theoretical computer science are studied.
<p>
In the first, there are n i.i.d. fair coin flips and k noncommunicating
players (working as a team) each of whom are sent these n coin flips. However,
independently for each player and for each coin, the incorrect
outcome is sent with probability epsilon. Each player is required to
`simulate a fair coin' based on what they receive, using no other
randomness. (For example, they might (1) just use the outcome of the
first coin they receive or (2) if n is odd, use a majority rule
meaning saying heads if and only if there are more heads than tails.)
The goal for the team is to maximize the probability that the outcomes of
the coins `tossed' by the k players are all equal. The question
is what is the maximal probability that can be achieved and what is the
optimal protocol that achieves this.
<p>
In the second model, player 1 receives n i.i.d. coin flips which
she sends to player 2, which in turn are sent to player 3, etc until
the kth player. Again, the coins are randomly corrupted as above and again
the players want to find a protocol (as above) maximizing the probability
that the outcomes of the coins `tossed' by the k players are all equal.
In this model, in turns out that the unique optimal protocol is
that everyone uses the outcome of the first coin they receive.
<p>
There is also a more general model encompassing both of the above
situations.

This is joint work with Elchanan Mossel, Ryan O'Donnell,
Oded Regev and Benny Sudakov.
