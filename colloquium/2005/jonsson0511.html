Singularities in geometry, complex dynamics and analysis

A curve in the plane is said to have normal crossings if it
lookslike $y=0$ or $xy=0$ in suitable local coordinates $(x,y)$ at
every point.An old theorem, going back at least to Max Noether,
asserts that everycurve in the plane---no matter how singular---can
be turned into one having normal crossings by a sequence of point
blowups, that is, a composition of coordinate changes of the form
$(x,y)\to(x,xy)$. This result, knownas embedded resolution of curve
singularities, was later vastly generalizedin the celebrated work by
Hironaka in the 1960's.I will discuss two recent (two-dimensional)
extensions of Noether's theoremobtianed jointly with C. Favre (CNRS,
Paris VII).The first one concerns resolutions of singularities of
positive closedcurrents (these can be viewed as "limits" of
curves). The secondis of dynamic nature and applies to fixed point
germs $f:(\mathbf{C}^2,0)\to(\mathbf{C}^2,0)$.
