<em>
From real ovals to complex crystals
</em>
</center></h1>


In 1871 Axel Harnack proved that a smooth real algebraic curve in the plane
cannot have more than (d-1)(d-2)+1 connected components, where d
denotes the degree of the curve. He also gave a construction of curves
having this maximal number of components, or "ovals". These matters were
pursued further by David Hilbert, who also included the study of ovals in
problem 16 of his famous list.
<p>

It has recently been discovered that the Harnack curves and their
complexifications possess many other extremal properties. For instance,
the amoeba of a complex Harnack curve is of maximal area, and it has the
maximal number of "holes" that precisely correspond to the ovals of the
real curve. In fact, the area of the holes can be taken as coordinates for
the moduli space of Harnack curves of a given degree.

<p>
In the work of Andrei Okounkov and his collaborators the very same Harnack
curves and their amoebas unexpectedly show up in combinatorial random
surface models for partially dissolved crystals.
