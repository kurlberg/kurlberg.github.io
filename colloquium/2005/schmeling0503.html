<em>
Dynamical Systems and Dimension Theory
</em>
</center></h1>


The <em>geometry</em> of many invariant sets of dynamical systems
(including attractors, repellers, level sets of dynamical
characteristics) look very complicated at <em> all scales</em>, and their
geometry is impossible to describe using standard geometric tools.
Several notions of dimension have proven to be quite useful to
quantify the complicated geometry of these sets. For some important
classes of dynamical systems, some of these notions of dimension are
intimately related to fundamental dynamical characteristics, such as
Lyapunov exponents, entropies, pressure, etc.
<p>

Tools from dynamical systems, especially from ergodic theory and
thermodynamic formalism, are extremely useful to compute and estimate
various dimensions.  This includes dimensions of limit sets of
geometric constructions (the standard Cantor set being most famous
example), which a priori, are not related to dynamical systems.
<p>

It has been known for many years that one can construct dynamical
systems exhibiting various pathological behaviors by requiring a key
dynamical characteristic to have special number theoretic properties
(such as requiring a rotation number to admit abnormally fast rational
approximations).  In a similar spirit, one can sometimes construct
pathological examples of dimension in dynamical systems using ideas in
number theory.
<p>

In this short survey we attempt to present some of the important
ideas, models, tools and results in the interplay of dimension theory
and dynamical systems, as well as to give a glimpse of applications in
disparate areas of mathematics.
