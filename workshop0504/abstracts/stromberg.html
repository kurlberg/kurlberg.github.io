<em>
Computational aspects of Maass cusp forms with nontrivial multiplier systems
</em>
</center></h1>
I will discuss some new methods that allow us to compute Maass
waveforms in a general setting. In particular we can now treat groups
with any number of cusps and Maass waveforms of any real weight and
transforming according to any multiplier system.

For those that don't know what a weight or a multiplier system is: the
physical interpretation of a Maass waveform with weight and multiplier
system is that of a quantum mechanical particle moving on a surface
where we have introduced a magnetic field. (The weight corresponds to
the field strength and the multiplier system to a consistent setup of
the magnetic fluxes through the cusps).
