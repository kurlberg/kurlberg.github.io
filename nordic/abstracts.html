<h2 id="sec-1">Henryk Iwaniec,   Critical zeros of \(L\)-functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This will be a survey talk on the distribution of zeros of
the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet \(L\)-series on the critical
line. The most recent result (joint with Brian Conrey and Kannan
Soundararajan) asserts that the \(L\)-functions have at least 60% zeros on
the line on average with respect to the characters. Small and large
gaps between zeros will be also discussed.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Steve Lester, Small scale equidistribution of eigenfunctions on the torus</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I will describe some recent results on the distribution of the
\(L^2\)-mass of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the torus
\(\mathbb{T}^d/ 2\pi \mathbb R^d\). A special case of a result of
Marklof and Rudnick implies that the \(L^2\)-mass of almost all such
eigenfunctions equidistributes with respect to Lebesgue measure for
\(d=2\). I will discuss results on the scales at which the \(L^2\)-mass
equidistributes as well as mention some limitations on
equidistribution, and relate these questions to arithmetic problems
such as representing integers as sums of squares and the distribution
of lattice points.  
</p>

<p>
This is joint work with Zeev Rudnick.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Martin Westerholt-Raum, Harmonic weak Siegel Maass forms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Harmonic weak Maass forms for \(SL(2,\mathbb{R})\)
where defined by Bruinier and Funke more than ten years ago. They have
been successfully applied to combinatorial problems thanks to their
overlap with indefinite theta functions. Their genuine arithmetic, on
the other hand, is linked to derivatives of \(L\)-series, as demonstrated
by Bruinier and Ono. We start by revisiting these connections.
</p>

<p>
Siegel modular forms are modular forms for the group \(Sp(g,\mathbb{R})\).
If \(g=1\)
they coincide with elliptic modular forms, but in the general case
they are more intricate. In joint work with Bringmann and Richter, the
speaker studied real analytic Siegel modular forms and connected their
Fourier Jacobi coefficients in the case of \(g=2\) to harmonic weak Maass
forms for \(SL(2,\mathbb{R})\). We showcase this connection, and exhibit the
importance of Fourier Jacobi coefficients in the study of Siegel
modular forms.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we discuss the existence of harmonic weak Siegel Maass forms. Using 
the connection of Eisenstein series and principal series representations, one 
manages to obtain sufficiently tight control of Dolbeault cohomology to show 
that every non-holomorphic Saito-Kurokawa lift can be further lifted to a 
harmonic weak Siegel Maass form. We discuss potential applications to 
derivatives of \(L\)-series.

We present a new uniform bound for the number of rational points of

previous bounds of Ellenberg/Venkatesh and Heath-Brown/Testa.

<p>
In this talk we discuss the distribution of low-lying zeros
of certain families of Artin L-functions attached to geometric
parametrizations of number fields. We describe several explicit
examples of such families and in each case we verify the Katz-Sarnak
heuristics and present the symmetry type of the distribution of
low-lying zeros.

<h2 id="sec-6">Morten Risager, The hyperbolic circle problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
We review the hyperbolic circle problem and explain some recent
results concerning the error term. We also explain how these results
relate to \(L\)-functions of certain automorphic forms and conjectures
about these.

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Fabien Pazuki, Bad reduction of curves with CM jacobians</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
An abelian variety defined over a number field and having
complex multiplication (CM) has potentially good reduction
everywhere. If a curve of positive genus which is defined over a
number field has good reduction at a given finite place, then so does
its jacobian variety. However, the converse statement is false already
in the genus \(2\) case, as can be seen in the entry \([I_0-I_0-m]\) in
Namikawa and Ueno's classification table of fibres in pencils of
curves of genus \(2\). In this joint work with Philipp Habegger, our main
result states that this phenomenon prevails for certain families of
curves.
</p>

<p>
We prove the following result: Let \(F\) be a real quadratic number
field. Up to isomorphisms there are only finitely many curves \(C\) of
genus \(2\) defined over \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) with good reduction
everywhere and such that the jacobian \(Jac(C)\) has CM by the maximal
order of a quartic, cyclic, totally imaginary number field containing
\(F\). Hence such a curve will almost always have stable bad reduction at
some prime whereas its jacobian has good reduction everywhere. A
remark is that one can exhibit an infinite family of genus \(2\) curves
with CM jacobian such that the endomorphism ring is the ring of
algebraic integers in a cyclic extension of \(\mathbb{Q}\) of degree \(4\)
that contains \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\).

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Julia Brandes, Linear spaces on hypersurfaces with a prescribed discriminant</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
For a given form \(F \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_s]\) we apply the circle
method in order to give an asymptotic estimate of the number of
\(m\)-tuples \(\mathbf x_1, \dots, \mathbf x_m\) on the hypersurface \(F(X)
= 0\) having \(\det ( \mathbf x_1, \dots, \mathbf x_m)^t \, (\mathbf
x_1, \dots, \mathbf x_m)) = b\). As a corollary, we obtain a count of
rational linear spaces contained in the hypersurface \(F(\mathbf x) =
0\) having dimension exactly \(m\), thus addressing a weakness of
previous results.  
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">Roope Vehkalahti, Coding on random lattices</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Classical information theory of additive white Gaussian noise channels
naturally suggests several coding theoretic problems that can be
formulated on lattice theoretic language. For example, performance of
a lattice code can be roughly estimated by it's Hermite invariant and
behavior of the related theta function.
</p>

<p>
Modern wireless communication channels assume use of multiple antennas
and that the transmitted signal gets faded by scattering
environment. On such channels classical lattice codes will not perform
well. In this talk we will describe how coding in modern fading
channels can be seen as coding on random lattice ensembles and how
this perspective transforms classical questions into new ones.
</p>

<p>
In particular we will show how classical Hermite invariant can be
replaced by different homogeneous forms and how class field towers
with constant root discriminants and non-commutative algebra can be
applied in building capacity approaching lattice codes for fading
channels.
</p>

<p>
If time allows we will discuss how averaging transforms theta
functions of lattices into sums of different type and how these sums
can be analyzed by employing methods from classical algebraic number
theory and ergodic theory on Lie groups.  
</p>


<p>
The talk is based on joint work with Laura Luzzi and Francis Lu.

<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">Wushi Goldring, Algebraicity of automorphic representations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
One striking implication of Langlands' conjectures for
number fields is that many automorphic representations which are
initially defined by analytic and/or representation-theoretic means
should have deep algebro-geometric properties, ranging from the
algebraicity of Hecke eigenvalues, to the existence of associated
Galois representations and ultimately pure motives. An example of a
long-standing open problem in this area which admits an elementary
formulation is to prove that Maass forms of eigenvalue \(1/4\) have
algebraic Hecke eigenvalues. Two approaches have been used to verify
Langlands' predictions: (1) Finding and exploiting a direct link with
algebraic geometry and (2) Using Langlands' Functoriality Principle. I
will discuss the possibilities and limitations of the two approaches
and report on recent work on each approach. The results using the
geometric approach are joint work with Jean-Stefan Koskivirta, see
arXiv:1507.05032.

<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">James Parks, Low-lying zeros of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
In this talk we study the \(1\)-level density of low-lying zeros of
Dirichlet \(L\)-functions attached to real primitive characters of
conductor at most \(X\). We obtain an asymptotic expansion of this
quantity with lower order terms in descending powers of \(\log X\). We
show that this is valid under GRH when the support of the Fourier
Transform of the implied even test function \(\phi\) is contained in
\((-2,2)\). We also uncover a phase transition when the supremum of the
support of $\widehat &phi; $ reaches \(1\), where a new lower order term
appears. 
</p>


<p>
This is joint work with Daniel Fiorilli and Anders Södergren.

<h2 id="sec-12">Tapani Matala-Aho, Around transcendence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
We will discuss on selected tools used in transcendence methods and
Diophantine approximations.
</p>
</div>
</div>




<div id="outline-container-sec-13" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-13">Simon Kristensen, Orbits of rotations and beyond</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
The orbit of a rotation of the unit circle has one of two behaviours as a
dynamical system, depending on whether the angle of rotation is a rational
or an irrational multiple of \(2\pi\). In the rational case, any orbit is
periodic; in the irrational case, any orbit is dense and in fact uniformly
distributed. A quantitative form of the uniform distribution of the
irrational orbits can be studied via the discrepancy of the sequence
\(\{n\alpha\}\) which in turn depends heavily on the continued fraction
expansion of \(\alpha\).
</p>

<p>
The study of orbits of rotations leads naturally to the notion of twisted
Diophantine approximation &#x2013; a form of inhomogeneous Diophantine
approximation, where one fixes the homogeneous parameter and studies the
possible approximation properties of the inhomogeneous parameter as it
varies. 
</p>

<p>
With Bugeaud, Harrap and Velani, we proved that the natural analogue of
badly approximable elements exist in abundance. To be precise, we proved
that for any \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\), the set
\[
\left\{x \in [0,1) : \Vert n\alpha - x\Vert \ge \frac{K(x)}{n} \text{ for
some \(K(x)> 0\) for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$}\right\}
\]
has maximal Hausdorff dimension and that this property is stable under
intersection with sufficiently nice fractals. In recent work in progress
with Tseng, this result is extended to the case when the rotation is
replaced by an Interval Exchange Transformation (IET). The added
difficulty of the IET setting comes from some highly geometric and
dynamical obstacles to a sufficiently nice behaviour of the appropriate
analogue of continued fractions.

<h2 id="sec-14">Lior Rosenzweig, Diophantine approximation in matrices and Lie groups</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
A classical question in Diophantine approximation is how well can a
real number be approximated by rationals. In this talk I will discuss
generalization of this question in two direction, namely to
approximation on submanifolds of R<sup>n</sup> , and more specifically to
submanifold of matrices, and approximation in Lie groups. We will also
discuss the optimal Diophantine exponent.

<div id="outline-container-sec-15" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-15">Fred Diamond, Serre weights and wild ramification</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<p>
Serre's Conjecture (proved by Khare and Wintenberger) asserts that
every odd, irreducible representation from \(\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})\) to
\(GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{p^r})\) arises from a modular form; furthermore Serre
specifies the minimal weight and level of a form giving rise to the
Galois representation.  The recipe for the weight depends on the local
behavior of the representation at the prime \(p\), and this dependence
becomes much more subtle in generalizations of Serre's Conjecture.  In
particular, when \(\mathbb{Q}\) is replaced by a totally real field, work of Gee
and others determines the weights of Hilbert modular forms giving rise
to a mod \(p\) Galois representation in terms of the existence of
crystalline lifts, but the dependence of the weights on wild
ramification is not explicit. I'll discuss joint work with Dembele
and Roberts towards making it so, or equivalently, describing wild
ramification in reductions of two-dimensional crystalline Galois
representations.
