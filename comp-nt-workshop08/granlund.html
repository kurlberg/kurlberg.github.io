GMP -- current and future algorithms and tricks
</em>
</center></h1>
<p>
  The goal with the GMP library for arithmetic on large integers, is to
  provide a building block for research and applications within the
  areas of computer algebra and computational number theory.  For this
  goal to succeed, performance and ease of use are central objectives.
<p>
  We will talk about the methods and tricks that make GMP fast, from
  algebra via dynamic algorithm choice to assembly loops.  We will also
  talk about areas were large improvements are planned, such as
  multiplication, division, operations in a ring, and operations with
  invariant operands.
