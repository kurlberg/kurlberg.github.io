Subquadratic GCD
</em>
</center></h1>

  Subquadratic divide-and-conquer algorithms for computing the
  greatest common divisor have been studied for a couple of decades.
  The integer case has been notoriously difficult, with the need for
  ``backup steps'' in various forms. This talk explains why backup
  steps are necessary for algorithms based directly on the quotient
  sequence, and proposes a robustness criterion that can be used to
  construct a ``half-gcd'' algorithm without any backup steps.
